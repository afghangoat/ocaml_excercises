# OCAML excercises

Some of the recursive math function reimplemented like the ackermann algorithm and the factorial. (Unfortunately the playground spoiled the fibonacci for me, so i didn't do that)

Also contains a nice poetry generator. It allows you to generate poetry like this:

`Poetry generated with length=100: 
here veil after embers there.
flame from echoing until memory,
without wind like fragile between.
ashen until falling where shadow,
being horizon as stormy being.
moonlit when silver been sky,
like mirror between sorrow upon.
sky was mist on stone,
until silent as ancient be.
flame is light within ashen,
there shore after silent above.
lonely but mist after ashen,
upon tender as eternal after.
eternal there flame are ancient,
is garden where light be.
sacred before mirror with dream,
within sacred so lonely nor.
flame being embers upon moonlit,
on eternal there mirror of.
memory so ashes and sorrow,
*so majestic*`
